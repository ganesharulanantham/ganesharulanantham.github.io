# Writing my mind
An idea behind this project is to kill my procrastination and hatterdness on html/css.


 - Setting public goals and achieve it.
 - Public weekly snippets to check my progress.
 - Express opinion straight and clear.
 - Experiment all ideas.
 - Capture all blogs, books & articles read. 
 
Inspiration for this?
> Is to create an idea image of myself in future as Ganny, plan backward and work forward to achieve it.

> Don't give a fcuk. Follow your passion. 

> Never fear to loss.
